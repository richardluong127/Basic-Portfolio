    About Me
</h2>

<p>
    I have been experiencing the front end result of many hours of collaborative effort by many developers on many projects.  Over two decades in, I am a consumer of digital content.  Just now, I recall that day I went home for the first time wearing a neckbrace attached to an aparatus housed in my mouth as a part of my ortho-prework.  It was to shift my molars back to create the space needed for braces to eventually shift my entire overbite back appropriately.  It was beyond my scope and I dredded the nagging pain, however, during that same time I also received a handme down NES with some video games and decided to try it out.  All of a sudden the pain became much lighter and I noticed my focus shifted away from the braces and onto what was happening right in front of me.  I have been hooked ever since!  With time, I was told it would change, but it looks like throughout all the years I was the one who turned out to be the constant :).
